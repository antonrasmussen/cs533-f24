    <p>Sierra Ferrell is my favorite singer-songwriter.</p>
    <p>
      I first learned of Sierra's music in about 2018 when I was living in Arkansas. After moving
      from Virginia to Arkansas, I rented a place in the Ozarks and wanted to get familiar with the 
      sounds of folk, Bluegrass, and the local music scene. I found Sierra's music on via YouTube and
      it was so raw that I was immediately hooked. I love her voice, her lyrics, and her style. She
      sings from the heart and her voice is amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been fortunate to see Sierra perform live and it was an amazing experience. While I missed a
      show of her's that I had tickets for in Eureka Springs, AR in February 2022, I was able to see her 
      perform at the Neptune Theater in Seattle, WA in May 2023 after moving there in 2022. This also happened to
      be the first concert that my 11 year old daughter attended. She loved it and we both had a great time! 
      We missed her again at the Seattle Zoo in August 2024 because I moved back to VA from Seattle. And sadly I will
      miss her again this weekend at IBMA Bluegrass Live in Raleigh, NC because I am going to to D.C. for a stand-up 
      show at the Lincoln Theater. If it sounds like she's busy, it's because she is. She's been touring a lot and
      will be headed to Austrailia in 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than her soulfoul voice, her lyrics, style, and guitar playing, I love that she's a great story teller. In my
      opinion this is what makes music great, in particular the singer-songwriter/folk/Bluegrass genre. 
      And of course I'm not alone, in the past decade she has gone from busking at Pike Place Market in Seattle to playing
      the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She's a friend of Dolly Parton and has been on stage with some of the greatest musicians
      of our era.
