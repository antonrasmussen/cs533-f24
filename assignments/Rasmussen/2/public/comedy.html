    <p>Shane Gillis is my favorite comedian because of how funny he is.</p>
    <p>
      While that is an obvious reason to like a comedian, I think the risks he
      takes balancing being offensive and being funny, how he uses his
      position to help his friends find success, and how he employs (often
      uncomfortable) aspects of U.S. History in his jokes are what makes him
      stand out among other comedians of his age and cohort.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who aren't aware, Shane was a cast member on
      <em>Saturday Night Live</em> for a week. He was fired before the season
      started when it was discovered that he had used racist slurs and made
      homophobic jokes on a podcast years prior to being cast on SNL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since being fired from SNL, he has been a guest on many podcasts, has a
      podcast of his own, has a show on Netflix called <em>Tires</em> and,
      after apologizing for his insensitive jokes, was even invited back to
      <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to host an episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I like the image of him at the Mall of America because I
      have performed stand-up comedy at that club and bombed so hard with my
      own poorly thought out, badly timed, insensitive jokes that I was never
      able to find the courage to get back on stage after the MC chastised me
      and the crowd turned on me. While Shane has definitely said things in
      his past that are offensive and regrettable, I think he is a good
      example of how someone can learn from their mistakes, grow as a person,
      and work to comeback from life's setbacks--for him that meant getting
      back up on stage, contiuing to tell risky jokes (with a new found
      attention to content), make people laugh, and do what he loves.
