      Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world action role-playing game and it's my
      favorite videogame.

      Set in the dystopian "Night City," Cyberpunk 2077 is a huge map that
      hosts a load of characters who are obsessed with power, weaponry,
      vehicles, and body modification. My character V is a mercenary going
      after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality. Keanu
      Reeves makes an appearance and lends a cool rock-star vibe to the game.

      Cyberpunk 2077 is probably my favorite game because of how many
      different things you can do in the game and because of the mix of rugged
      and futuristic "Cyberpunk" esthetics, which appeals to my love of
      technology. One of the coolest easter eggs that I have found in the game
      are these game-within-a game video games that you can play--they are fun
      enough that I have spent hours playing them instead of the main game
      lol.
