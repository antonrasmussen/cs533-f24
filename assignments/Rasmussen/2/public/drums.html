    <p>
      Carter Beauford is my favorite drummer because of how musical he is. His
      open style playing (left-hand lead) is the result of watching Buddy Rich
      on TV at such a young age (two years old) that he didn't realize that
      when he set the drums up to match Buddy's kit he was actually seeing a
      mirror image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this simple "mistake," Carter began a journey of drumming
      with a unique style of playing that afforded him an ambidextrous ability
      to easily move around the drums and fludily play beats no matter which
      hand played which drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who aren't aware, he is the drummer for the Dave Matthews
      Band.
