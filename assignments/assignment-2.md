Points available: 15

### node.js, express, cookie-parser

* Install node.js, express, and cookie-parser on your local machine

### set up a server 

* Set up and run a server on your local machine
* Install four "paths" on your server, with each path corresponding to a favorite artist, musician, film, or TV series.  For example, my paths might be:
   * localhost:4000/djshadow
   * localhost:4000/game-of-thrones.html
   * localhost:4000/silo.html
   * localhost:4000/Ozark
* For each path, have a sentence or two in HTML that explains why this is a favorite of yours
* For each path, set a cookie that echos the corresponding favorite of yours (make up a syntax for your key-value pair, but keep the values human-readable)

### Youtube video

* Record your screen of you 1) viewing the files, 2) starting the server, 3) loading each of the four paths in your browser.  

### Put files in your forked repo, issue a Pull Request to my repo

* In your local repo, create:

```
mkdir assignments/YOURLASTNAME/2
```

For example, for me it would be:

```
mkdir assignments/Nelson/2
```

* In this directory, upload all of your *.html, *.js, and a README.md file that documents the assignment and includes a link to the Youtube video.  You MUST include a README.md file.  

* When finished, use GitHub to issue a Pull Request to my repo. 

### 2 points extra credit available

* install and demonstrate a favicon.ico for your site
