    <h1>Barney Miller</h1>
    <p>
      "Barney Miller" is a favorite TV show due to its witty humor and the fact that my grandpa would watch it every night with me. Arthur Dietrich is probably the funniest character ever written (subjectively), the theme song has the hardest bass line of all time (objectively), and the way Barney leads the detective squad is like a master class in effective leadership.
