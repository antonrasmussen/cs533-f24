    <h1>Bad Religion</h1>
    <p>
      Bad Religion was the first band that grabbed my attention that wasn't something my parents listened to when I was growing up, like Van Halen or Lynyrd Skynyrd. My older cousin was listening to their album Suffer on cassette one day and I was instantly into it, he gave me the tape and I immediately got in trouble for taking it to school which just made me like it even more.
